louieismyname,getting it zoned correctly would be a challenge
pokimanesfeet,also no one cares about the map but me
pokimanesfeet,from the zoner before dini so
louieismyname,wack
pokimanesfeet,ye u do
louieismyname,thought you were meaning skip itself after you have boost
louieismyname,cos that doesn't happen on ksf
louieismyname,ohh do you get your speed reset
pokimanesfeet,startzone is too close to boost trigger
louieismyname,or that
louieismyname,o
louieismyname,might be a model size thing again cos i felt like i had space
pokimanesfeet,ye think on gfl its zoning issue
louieismyname,uhh i didn't have a lot of trouble with it but i practiced it a bunch
louieismyname,ye that's why keeping speed makes it easier but you also have to watch out not to have too much
pokimanesfeet,also the double boost on stage 18 seems really tight is it like that on ksf?
pokimanesfeet,but u barely make it
pokimanesfeet,I kinda found a paint strat where u just jump straight into the hole with 0 speed and line up with the paint line
louieismyname,less room for error
louieismyname,ye it'll be fucked
pokimanesfeet,yea so I think its even worse
louieismyname,even harder with fat models so gl
louieismyname,you're playing on go too right
pokimanesfeet,fml
louieismyname,other than that it's fully skill issue
louieismyname,"gotta learn how to bash the walls in between ""stages"" so you don't have too much speed and get used to lining up sideways with the hole"

Deleted User,gfl is selling privs for $15 rn to aussies and costs more to run csgo servers
Deleted User,only reason I'll never play ksf seriously even though I really want to is cause of priv costs and cant find someone that will let me in for like $15
Deleted User,same with eu 13 servers

pokimanesfeet,Not even close to fair considering we somewhat know the cost is nowhere near $100

pokimanesfeet,lower priced privates would solve it butowners just greedy

pokimanesfeet,"reason why is because it is straight up not fun and maps are extended for hours, no way you get a map u want unless its weird hours"
pokimanesfeet,I cant play on ksf anyways as a new player cuz I dont have a private so idk why I even comment tbh
granis,ye im just giving you my pov
pokimanesfeet,if u guys wanna keep it the same its completely fine
pokimanesfeet,I only want like 2 maps changed tiers so its really not that big of a deal
granis,ye but its like tier 4
pokimanesfeet,id say thats why its unpopular
pokimanesfeet,isnt jushched a pretty long linear
granis,clavius do be very hard for a tier 5 but its also not a very popular map
granis,jusched is one of the easiest tier 6 maps out there and it has much less completion than pretty much all other tier 6 maps because noone likes playing it

CS:GO Standing: 73```"
granis,pretty sure its still 45 degree thing
granis,"upwards ramp is same thing, just its on x/z rather than x/y"
merkycinq,Requires more complicated math involving height of hitbox
merkycinq,The upwards ramp is fucked as well
tucks.,Gottem
tucks.,XD
granis,ez now do that in run
merkycinq,That's how much closer to the ramp you are on 45 degree angle

afonsowo,def something to try
granis,so you can go from 2nd to top and not have to turn too fast wrapping from top to top
